# Signal-Processing-MATLAB
Using Fourier analysis and Fourier Transform, I calculate coefficients for seismogram signals and analyse Earthquake Magnitude Scale and it's effect on different buildings  
I also analyse different sound inputs and find the musical notes played in a music file.  
There's much more to this project so please check out the description file for more information.
